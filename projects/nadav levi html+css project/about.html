                <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
                <p>
                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations are
                    concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                    (the start of lent in
                    the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually
                    begins on King’s Day
                    (12th Night, January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls
                    start soon after,
                    though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and
                    their courts
                    consisting of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat
                    Tuesday gets nearer,
                    the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
                    days have several
                    large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                    Gras season. In the
                    final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades
                    and balls (some of
                    them masquerade balls).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route
                    each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and
                    the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events (often featuring
                    celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a
                    predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are
                    strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes
                    follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and
                    Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French
                    Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and 'tit Rex - also take place downtown in the Faubourg
                    Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes with the
                    "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>Early history</h3>
                <p>
                    The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now
                    lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an
                    observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730
                    account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing).
                    An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
                    streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such
                    restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.
                    
                    In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to fund an
                    official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces
                    describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic
                    masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and
                    girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical,
                    diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds
                    with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon;
                    mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars,
                    &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and
                    all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras
                    with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus. According to one
                    historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French
                    festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from
                    French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a
                    certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business
                    prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from
                    Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of
                    Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the
                    streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."
                    
                    In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather conditions
                    sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I and
                    World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
                    
                    The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The rumored but
                    long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one transporting a
                    live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the
                    National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.
                </p>
                <h3>20th and 21st centuries</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to surrounding
                    communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city. Masking,
                    costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes
                    against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some
                    in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi Gras
                    Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation,
                    to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these
                    krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly
                    private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand
                    otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in
                    the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal courts later
                    declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and an
                    unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court refused to hear
                    the city's appeal from this decision.
                    
                    Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues, and any member
                    can have a place on a parade float.
                </p>
                <h4>Effects of Hurricane Katrina</h4>
                <p>
                    The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question the future of the city's
                    Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this sentiment for
                    electoral advantage. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's
                    revival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration to limit strains
                    on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so negotiations
                    between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than
                    originally suggested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the
                    French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on Saturday,
                    February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily from Thursday night through Mardi
                    Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted
                    to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Some
                    krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered by
                    that neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end. National Guard troops
                    assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as they have many
                    times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and
                    removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's aftermath. Many
                    had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an affirmation of life.
                    The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations
                    of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much
                    mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians.
                    
                    By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding their parades
                    Uptown.
                </p>
                <h4>2020 tandem float incidents</h4>
                <p>
                    In 2020, two parade attendees—one during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion parade, were killed after being
                    struck and run over in between interconnected "tandem floats" towed by a single vehicle. Following the incident during
                    the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address safety issues with these floats (including
                    outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a barrier). Following the second death during the Endymion
                    parade on February 22, 2020 (which caused the parade to be halted and cancelled), city officials announced that tandem
                    floats would be banned effective immediately, with vehicles restricted to one, single float only.

                <h2>Traditional colors</h2>
                <p>
                    The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The colors were first
                    specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that
                    balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts
                    suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the colors were
                    based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor
                    to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other
                    national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies
                    with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and
                    that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed around the
                    concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized justice, power, and
                    faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order
                    technically violates the rule of tincture.
                </p>
                <h2>Contemporary Mardi Gras</h2>
                <h3>Epiphany</h3>
                <p>
                    Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least 1900; locally,
                    it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5, the evening of the
                    twelfth day of Christmastide. The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have staged a parade and
                    masked ball on this date since 1870. A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La Société Pas Si
                    Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on Epiphany as
                    well.
                    
                    Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no longer parade
                    in public.
                    
                    Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.

                <h3>Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</h3>
                <p>
                    A 2020 study estimated that Mardi Gras brings 1.4 million visitors to New Orleans.
                    
                    Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest all-female Krewe. Nyx is
                    famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their founding in 2011.
                    
                    Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is relatively new,
                    but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly sought-after decorated
                    shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.
                    
                    Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades, ending with one of the
                    fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus. There are several smaller neighborhood parades like the Krewe of
                    Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.
                    
                    Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on Sunday (Thoth, Okeanos, and
                    Krewe of Mid-City).
                    
                    The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus parade on Sunday
                    night.

                <h3>Mardi Gras Day</h3>
                <p>
                    The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending
                    on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).
                    
                    In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and ending at Broad
                    and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St.
                    Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire
                    families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller parades and
                    walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club,
                    Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French
                    Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne journeys from the
                    Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from bar to
                    bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into uptown and
                    downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

                <h2>Costumes and masks</h2>
                <p>
                    In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat Tuesday (other
                    than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask are
                    suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as
                    convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.
                </p>
                <h2>Throws</h2>
                <p>
                    A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to parade-goers. Until the 1960s, the
                    most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in Czechoslovakia.
                    
                    Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong, then from Taiwan,
                    and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float-riders to purchase greater quantities, and throws
                    have become more numerous and common.
                    
                    In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they landed on the ground.
                    Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals, people, or other objects have become the
                    sought-after throws. David Redmond's 2005 film of cultural and economic globalization, Mardi Gras: Made in China,
                    follows the production and distribution of beads from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of New Orleans
                    during Carnival. The publication of Redmon's book, Beads, Bodies, and Trash: Public Sex, Global Labor, and the
                    Disposability of Mardi Gras, follows up on the documentary by providing an ethnographic analysis of the social harms,
                    the pleasures, and the consequences of the toxicity that Mardi Gras beads produce.
                    
                    In addition to the toxicity of tons of plastic, eye injuries from Mardi Gras parade throws are commonplace, and more
                    severe injuries—such as a fractured skull in an infant struck by a coconut—have also been known to occur.

                <h2>Other Mardi Gras traditions</h2>
                <h3>Social clubs</h3>
                <p>
                    New Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration as hosts of many of the parades on or
                    around Mardi Gras. The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades. Zulu is a mostly
                    African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting in late January. At
                    these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and 21, not married and in
                    high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present themselves and their court of maids
                    (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball and parade, such
                    as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After their exclusion from Rex, in 1909 Black Creole and other African American New Orleanians, led by a mutual aid
                    group known as "The Tramps", adorned William Storey with a tin can crown and banana stalk scepter and named him King
                    Zulu. This display was meant as a mockery of Rex's overstated pageantry but in time, Zulu became a grand parade
                    in its own right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu's increase in prestige, the krewe named New Orleans' native son
                    Louis Armstrong as its king.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being a member of the court requires much preparation, usually months ahead. Women and girls must have dress fittings as
                    early as the May before the parade, as the season of social balls allows little time between each parade. These balls
                    are generally by invitation only. Balls are held at a variety of venues in the city, large and small, depending on the
                    size and budget of the organization. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the French Opera House was a leading venue
                    for New Orleans balls. From the mid 20th century until Hurricane Katrina the Municipal Auditorim was the city's most
                    famous site for Carnival balls. In more recent years, most are at the ballrooms of various hotels throughout the city.
                    The largest "Super Krewes" use larger venues; Bacchus the Morial Convention Center and Endymion the Superdome.
                </p>
                <h3>Doubloons</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the many Mardi Gras throws which krewes fling into the crowds, doubloons are large coins, either wood or metal,
                    made in Mardi Gras colors. Artist H. Alvin Sharpe created the modern doubloon for The School of Design (the actual name
                    of the Rex organization). According to the krewe history, in January 1959 Sharpe arrived at the offices of the captain
                    of the krewe with a handful of aluminum discs. Upon entering the office, he threw the doubloons into the captain's face
                    to prove that they would be safe to throw from the floats. Standard krewe doubloons usually portray the Krewe's emblem,
                    name, and founding date on one side, and the theme and year of the parade and ball on the other side. Royalty and
                    members of the court may throw specialty doubloons, such as the special Riding Lieutenant doubloons given out by men on
                    horseback in the Rex parade. In the last decade, krewes have minted doubloons specific to each float. Krewes also mint
                    special doubloons of cloisonné or pure silver for its members. They never throw these from the floats. Original Rex
                    doubloons are valuable, but it is nearly impossible for aficionados to find a certified original doubloon. The School of
                    Design did not begin dating their doubloons until a few years after their introduction.
                </p>
                <h3>Flambeau carriers</h3>
                <p>
                    The flambeau (pronounced "flahm-bo", meaning flame-torch) carrier originally, before electric lighting, served as a
                    beacon for New Orleans parade goers to better enjoy the spectacle of night parades. The first flambeau carriers were
                    slaves. Today, the flambeaux are a connection to the New Orleans version of Carnival and a valued contribution. Many
                    people view flambeau-carrying as a kind of performance art – a valid assessment given the wild gyrations and flourishes
                    displayed by experienced flambeau carriers in a parade. Many individuals are descended from a long line of carriers.
                    Parades that commonly feature flambeaux include Babylon, Bacchus, Chaos, Le Krewe d'Etat, Druids, Endymion, Hermes,
                    Krewe of Muses, Krewe of Orpheus, Krewe of Proteus, Saturn, and Sparta. Flambeaux are powered by naphtha, a highly flammable aromatic. It is a tradition, when the flambeau carriers pass by during a parade, to toss
                    quarters to them in thanks for carrying the lights of Carnival. In the 21st century, though, handing dollar bills is
                    common.
                </p>
                <h2>Rex</h2>
                <p>
                    Each year in New Orleans, krewes are responsible for electing Rex, the king of the carnival. The Rex Organization
                    was formed to create a daytime parade for the residents of the city. The Rex motto is, "Pro Bono Publico—for the public
                    good.
                </p>
                <h3>New Orleans Zulu or Mardi Gras Coconut</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most famous and the most sought after throws, is the Zulu Coconut also known as the Golden Nugget and the
                    Mardi Gras Coconut. The coconut is mentioned as far back as 1910, where they were given in a natural "hairy" state.
                    The coconut was thrown as a cheap alternative, especially in 1910 when the bead throws were made of glass. Before the
                    Krewe of Zulu threw coconuts, they threw walnuts that were painted gold. This is where the name "Golden Nugget"
                    originally came from. It is thought that Zulu switched from walnuts to coconuts in the early 1920s when a local painter,
                    Lloyd Lucus, started to paint coconuts. Most of the coconuts have two decorations. The first is painted gold with added
                    glitter, and the second is painted like the famous black Zulu faces. In 1988, the city forbade Zulu from throwing
                    coconuts due to the risk of injury; they are now handed to onlookers rather than thrown. In the year 2000, a local
                    electronics engineer, Willie Clark, introduced an upgraded version of the classic, naming them Mardi Gras Coconuts.
                    These new coconuts were first used by the club in 2002, giving the souvenirs to royalty and city notables.

                <h3>Ojen liqueur</h3>
                <p>
                    Aguardiente de Ojén (es), or simply "ojen" ("OH-hen") as it is known in English, is a Spanish anisette traditionally
                    consumed during the New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities. In Ojén, the original Spanish town where it is produced,
                    production stopped for years, but it started again in early 2014 by means of the distillery company Dominique Mertens
                    Impex. S.L.
                </p>
                <h3>House floats</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2021 due to the cancellation of parades due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the practice of decorating homes in the style
                    of parade floats emerged as an alternative, dubbed "home floats" or "house floats". The concept was popularized
                    immediately after the announcement that in-person parades would be prohibited, stemming from a post on Twitter by Megan
                    Boudreaux. She later established a formal "Krewe of House Floats", with participants being listed in an interactive map
                    on its website so local residents can tour them. The revised celebration was nicknamed "Yardi Gras" by
                    residents. Even the dog parade, held by the Mystic Krewe of Mardi Paws in Covington, opted to make "dog house
                    floats' in 2021.
                </p>
                <h3>Public nudity</h3>
                <p>
                    Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented since 1889, when
                    the Times-Democrat decried the "degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the streets."
                    Risqué costumes, including body painting, are fairly common. The practice of exposing female breasts in exchange for
                    Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the crowded
                    streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form
                    on the streets.

                    In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs helped
                    encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists studying
                    "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or other favors.

                <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                <p>
                    Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of
                    Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the Harvard Kennedy
                    School.
                </p>
                <h3>Broadmoor neighborhood work</h3>
                <p>
                    Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board of the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005 levee failures in
                    Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly
                    deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by
                    then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to be
                    converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents and local
                    religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor
                    residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow residents formed
                    the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a
                    founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case
                    management and other social services for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts to reopen
                    Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a
                    partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided the
                    neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a partnership between the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and
                    Wellness Center.
